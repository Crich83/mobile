## Welcome to Module 06 Documentation

The main purpose of this site was to practice and learn how to deisgn a mobile application. We were to add a user interface, that included things such as lists, forms, panels, grids, webstorage, and widgets.

### Website structure + Descriptions of pages, buttons, users actions

The main interface top left has a panel widget with a dropdown menu that includes 6 options to choose. Also there is a filter input box, to filter out the listview to find the list item without having to scroll down. Next there is section #1-6 and, 3 "come in sections" that link to a description page that information can be added on as more detailed topics are added. Form listitem is to store, clear, and empty the localstorage. Form 2 is a form to send contact information from user input. The grid listitem has 4 columns with blended colors of each column. Webstorage favorite item, gets and stores favorite item of a user input. Webstorage favorite list listitem is to store and get favorite list of items. I also used theme roller to change the theme of the overall application, and added hearts as icons for each listitem on homepage.
